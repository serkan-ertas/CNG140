there are 3 hospitals and there are people staying in them.

we create 2 variable admitted and recovered.
they'll get a value randomly, and admitted>recovered
(admitted and recovered people are fixed in each month and for all hospitals)

total admitted and recovered people in "n months" will be calculated by a recursive function.
then you'll print the density of the hospital 1/2/3 according to their beginning patient number.


Line by Line Explanation

7:	you need to define the symbolic constant N with #define
	if you do it with " int N=3; " , you'll lose points


9-16:
	number_patients function takes 4 values:
		patients: the beginning patient number of hospital 1/2/3  -->line 37-46, the code wants this value
		recovered , admitted: randomly gets a value		-->line 52-55
		month: how many months we'll calculate		-->line 49-50

18-28:
	hospital_ranking function takes 2 values:
		beginning: the beginning patient number a hospital
		ending: the number of patients after n months,
			   it is calculated by the number_patients function,
			    at line 63, you can see the second input for hospital_ranking function is the number_patients function
		this function prints blue/yellow/red according to the density of the hospital 1/2/3 according to their beginning patient number

30-73: MAIN FUNCTION:

	32: it is important to define your array with the symbolic constant N (in my code it is: int arr[N] )
	
	37-46: it takes our arr[] elements, which are ( 1<= n <=50 )

	48-50: month input

	52-55: admitted and recovered variables randomly get a value that is between 1 and 10, until admitted>recovered

	59-64: executes the code for each hospital
